    <h2 id = "intro">Hi I'm Emma!</h2>
    <p>A computer science and software engineering student at Rose-Hulman Institute of technology. I have experience with Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, C, and Python but my specialty is java development. I'm particularly interested in machine learning, cybersecurity, and robotics.</p>
    <p>Outside the classroom, I love crocheting figurines, I could most probably form a militia with the amount of Grogu's I've made. Besides that I enjoy playing video games, thrifting, and hanging out with my Lizard, LG! No correlation to the electronics company, although that would be fitting.  </p>
